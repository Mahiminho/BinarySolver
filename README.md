<h1 align="center">BinarySolver</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This is my first major project in the Python programming language written in September 2022 when I was a second-year student. What is it for? 
It performs calculations instead of a student. You can see the variants of this work and tasks in the file OOFK_RGR_tasks.pdf. 
I am a Ukrainian student, so all the tasks are written in Ukrainian. The program does not have a graphical interface yet. 
At that time, I was just starting to learn Python, so all comments in the code are also written in Ukrainian. 
Also, the code has a significant number of unoptimized functions in the modules, which slightly impairs the readability of the code.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>In order to use the program, you need to open the main.py file and change the data that is already written in</p>
<p>
    <code>
        module_task1.task1("Що прийнято називати основою системи числення:")
        module_task2.task2("2712,663 134,223 110001110010101,10111001")
        module_task3.task3("56,455 2343167,64")
        module_task4.task4("315,783 317712,56 123321,21 1010,10201 3456,345609")
        module_task5.task5("275+333 426–222")
        module_task6.task6("295,4301")
        module_task7.task7("1010,11011*10+11 0,00001001*10+101")
        module_task8.task8("А=-0,101010 В=+0,000111")
        module_task9.task9("А=-0,101010*10-101 В=-0,000111*10-011")
    </code>
</p>
<p>to your own data, according to your version of the task (<i>Enter your values according to the template below or the template you are changing!</i>). 
Then run the program and look at the generated file OOFK_RGR.txt, where you will find the ready-made solutions to your tasks.</p>
<h2>What tasks does it solve?</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Answer the following questions;</li>
        <li>Determine the decimal values of the given numbers;</li>
        <li>Convert the given decimal numbers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal;</li>
        <li>Specify the minimum base of the number system to which the given numbers can belong;</li>
        <li>In the given arithmetic expressions, convert the unsigned decimal numbers to their binary equivalents and perform the appropriate operations. Check the results;</li>
        <li>Convert a decimal number from one number system to another with an accuracy of d<sup>-4</sup> (d is the base of the number system);</li>
        <li>Normalize the numbers in the moving-point format and write them in normal form;</li>
        <li>Add binary numbers in fixed-point format in the complement and inverse codes;</li>
        <li>Add in the modified complementary code binary numbers in the format of a moving point with base d=2.</li>
    </ol> 
</p>
<h2>Who needs it?</h2>
<p>First-year computer students who have to study this discipline and do not have time to do this work. 
If the tasks in the guidelines in the pdf file are the same as yours, you can save a lot of time.</p>
